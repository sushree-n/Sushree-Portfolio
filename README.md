Hi! I'm Sushree, a passionate developer, AI explorer, and lifelong learner. I love building creative solutions at the intersection of technology and real-world impact. My journey spans AI/ML, web development, and research, with a knack for turning ideas into beautiful, functional products. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new places, reading, or experimenting in the kitchen. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
